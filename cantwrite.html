      Writing has always come easy to me, I wrote fan fiction in between classes
      when I was 14 and at some point my harry potter fan fiction finished the
      whole diary I was writing in. Words used to flow out of me with a
      confidence that it deserves to be seen. It wants to be read, felt and
      traverse through minds that aren’t my own.

      <br /><br />

      But in the past few months I noticed how hard and daunting it was to
      write. Writing was my most confident skill. And I couldn’t dip into it
      anymore. The times when I felt awful, I wrote to feel better and vent.
      When all my skills failed - as a designer, as a creative person ; writing
      pulled me out of the dumps. But not anymore, I was terrified of writing
      and anybody seeing it, thinking that maybe - I wasn’t as imaginitive and
      colourful with my words as I thought I was, the articulation I relied on
      to feel intellectually superior than everyone else in the world, just felt
      out of reach.
      <br /><br />
      What happened? How can I lose something so innate to me?
      <br /><br />
      Turns out there was someone else that had started living in my head. There
      is a voice that starts growing in your mind when somebody is constantly
      butting heads with you. It happens slowly - when you express your opinions
      on things, express how you think your reality works and it’s met with
      criticism more often. The voice starts to dwindle, if everything is wrong
      - there must be something I’m doing wrong, I’m probably living wrongly,
      *what I feel is probably wrong and I don’t know enough*
      <br /><br />
      -crack-
      <br /><br />
      Every time you feel something “I probably don’t know everything, I should
      ask more questions, be more patient”
      <br /><br />
      One day you hear yourself speak less to others - “I probably don’t have
      anything valuable to say”
      <br /><br />
      And not very long while later “I probably don’t know what I feel” you
      start outsourcing your own voice with whatever others around you say.
      <br /><br />
      It’s not a writing problem, it’s not a creative block, it’s you not
      hearing yourself at all because “you’re probably wrong anyway”. And when
      everything you say to yourself is met with dismissal (by you), the
      emotional response to a thought, a feeling or even a germ of an idea is
      met with discomfort and exhaustion. And your ideas never live to see the
      light. Let alone on paper, even within yourself.
      <br /><br />
      I am still struggling to figure out how one gets out of this. But I write
      with friends, I write alone, I write garbage, I write when I have
      thoughts. And I never ever judge, not my own or others. Just digging down
      to the fundamentals of why writing exists - to convey ideas. If you can
      convey whatever it is you want to say, you have succeeded in writing. No
      matter the colour of phrasing, the vocabulary or sentence flow. It only
      matters that you write like the fan fiction writer that wrote so that they
      can bring into life something they cannot stop thinking about. No matter
      that it is painfully embarassing to put your name to (some of these ao3
      harry-draco smut writers have the confidence I wish to possess one day).
      The creativity that lives within you deserves to be written down so you
      can live a little lighter (and there are definitely people out there who
      feel as you do and are begging to feel like what they feel is not this
      foreign awful thing but just *human* ) So, write until you feel like it
      and whenever you are ready bless the world with what you feel and be
      blessed when somebody somewhere inevitably feels less alone by your
      writing. The words that you mould have more power than your brain is
      capable of imagining.
      <br /><br />
      (and evaluate your friendship/relationship/work-ship/whatever-ship with
      the person causing you to constantly rewrite your own feelings)
