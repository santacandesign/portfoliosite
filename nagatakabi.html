    <br />
    <h5>
      I started reading it by the recommendation of Gabby Caldera - link to the
      recommendation video here
    </h5>
    <br />
    <h5>
      These works are autobiographical and the titles were tempting. I started
      reading and I could not stop. I wanted to know more. Seeing an adult in
      their 30s going through the things that she was important to me. Going in
      and out of her parent’s home needing support for recovery, but still
      struggling with her relationship with them. Making her art keeps her alive
      and happy but upsets her parents and then follows the perpetual abuse
      cycle “you could be doing something better”, “get a job”, even though she
      already had a job, making manga. She made money from it too.
      <br /><br />
      The struggle with loneliness, substances and approval from parents; the
      burdening existence of being alive when you didn’t grow up learning the
      skills you need to be an autonomous adult - all these themes still feel
      extremely unexplored from an adult, especially a queer adult in Asia. When
      you’re a disabled queer adult, you get used to depending on your parents
      for executive function and financial support, they do nothing to change
      this. They revel in the fact that their kids still need them. Thus
      perpetuating the cycle, never being free to know who you are, what you
      want or make space for how you feel + express them. It was devastating
      watching her fall into alcoholism - at first, to experience autonomy as an
      adult and then as an escape leading to addiction; hiring a female escort
      to experience intimacy at all knowing how homophobic japan can be and
      struggling to form relationships that mature into love. <br /><br />
      In wandering warrior existence, she talks about how happy her friends look
      getting married, how badly she wants that for herself. And the gap she
      feels between herself and them who are capable of forming relationships
      that turn into marriage.

    <h5>
      I have felt that all my life, there was a bond that kids seem to have with
      each other that allowed them to get close and some of them going as far as
      being in love. I didn’t experience that up until my 20s. I knew what
      having a crush felt like, but I couldn’t fathom being in love where you’ve
      spent so long being close to someone that you both now are in love. Hard
      relate.

      In my twisted eating disorder she talks about liking margarine on her
      bread just because the container’s shape and its soft.

      I have forever avoided things that make my hands get wet before consuming.
      It was way too relatable to know that someone other than me has all these
      arbitrary reasons for loving something that has nothing to do with the
      thing but the way its packaged or helps me avoid a texture I hate.

    <h5>
      There are many more instances like this, that made me feel like Nagata
      Kabi is living example of “your suffering isn’t unique”. It was almost
      freaky. But I am thankful to know that there are adults struggling with
      things like this and I am not alone. For every adult out there, doing
      their best despite knowing they’re struggling with things unfathomable to
      other people, carrying burdens just to be alive.
    </h5>
    <br /><br />
    <h5>
      To all of you, thank you for being alive. Please make art and be
      vulnerable. It means a lot to know I am not alone and I am not pathetic
      for going through the things that I do. <br /><br />
      Please know you don’t need anyone’s permission or approval to be alive. No
      one to please, nobody else’s metric but your own to know your life is
      fulfilling and worth living.
      <br /><br />
      There is joy to be had by just being alive. Experiences to seek out that
      have nothing to do with having a job or being in love. Never apologise for
      feeling what you feel.
      <br /><br />
      Please checkout Nagata Kabi’s work and talk about it so they publish these
      comics in india and I can buy them. I had to go to the depths of the
      internet, I wouldn’t go with a gun to find all the titles and read them.
      If you do read them, please tell me about it so we can gush over it
      together.
      <br /><br />
      And Nagata Kabi, never ever stop writing. Your work is saving people’s
      lives and please stay safe and be happy :D I hope one day I can meet you
      and tell you how much your work means to me. I will read everything you
      will ever write.
      <br /><br />
      Love,
      <br />
