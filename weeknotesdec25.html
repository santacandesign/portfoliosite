    <h5>
      It’s my second week of burnout recovery. I did a lot for someone that is
      as severely burntout as I am I can’t even listen to music without getting
      overwhelmed. So that’s where I am mentally <br />
      <br />
      1. I made a meal for myself every single day at least two times without
      fail <br />
      2. I deadlifted 50kgs for a whole set and my back still hurts from that
      <br />
      3. I made a friend of many years, my very special ramen that he loved so
      much he said he had to “close his eyes to experience it fully” <br />
      4. I went to a tiny concert of the main singer of Green park in a home
      with about 20 people <br />
      5. I watched kajillionaire which was so funny, sad and wonderful <br />
      6. I ate two boxes of strawberries <br />
      7. I came to the indie web club to figure out how to start a blog
      connected to my site hehe <br />
      8. I told my friends something hard I’ve been dealing with <br />
      9. I interviewed more people that are currently unemployed and I realised
      I make people talk and be vulnerable which I really enjoyed doing <br />
      10. I made a poster on affinity <br />
      11. I restarted using obsidian which I love <br />
      12. I successfully quit drinking tea because the caffeine was killing me
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>My predictions for 2026</h2>
      <h5>
      1. I will feel better <br />
      2. My friendships will feel closer and kinder <br />
      3. I will eat a lot more dosas recommended by ajith bhasker <br />
      4. Hopefully AI stuff will stabilise so everybody can understand where
      they now will fall in the job market again <br />
      5. More people feel empowered to start businesses <br />
      6. More people will talk to each other and the world will get less lonely
      <br />
      7. massive neocities come back (i hope) <br /><br />
      
      <h2>What I hope happens in 2026 </h2> <h5>
      1. I will collaborate with folks in academia to present their
      ideas better using design (& data visualization) <br />2. I will code more
      <br />3. I will feel closer to who I am as a person <br />
      4. People get kinder that’s all, I don’t want to ask more of santa. This
      is hopefully an achievable goal (for both the white man grandpa in red
      clothes and me)
