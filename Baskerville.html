    <h5>
      The typeface was designed by John Baskerville in 1757, Birmingham England.
      Typography cut by punchcutter John Handy. <br /><br />
      Transitional typeface which reduced the contrast between thick and thin
      strokes with a vertical axis.
      <br /><br />
      Isaac Moore created a version called “Fry’s baskervile” or “Baskerville
      old Face”
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h2>History & technical context of its design</h2><br />
      <h5>
        Baskerville made his money by selling lacquered goods and transformed
        the quality of printing in england by using level presses, better
        quality ink and glazing papers to have a smooth finish (woven paper it
        was called)
        <br /><br />
        He was also a calligraphy teacher that heavily inspired his font. His
        typeface is very similar to the tombstones he used to carve in the
        1730s. He spent seven years developing his printing project and even
        advertised in 1754 in books like Vergil and Paradise lost. In 1758, he
        became the University Printer in Cambridge University Press.
        <br /><br />
        He wasn’t successful in the local england print scene, initially. People
        went as far as to say his font damaged their eyes. But abroad he had
        started garnering fans (imitators even) like Benjamin Franklin (yes,
        that benjamin franklin, he started out as a printer), Giambattista
        Bodoni who wrote him letters praising his work.
        <br /><br />
        Also to be noted, Bold weights were not present in his original
        rendition that were only added in modern revivals
      </h5>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h2>Uses</h2><br />
      <h5>
        In the past it was used to print <i>serious</i> books such as previously
        mentioned vergil, a paradise lost, versions of the bible. <br />
        Currently it is for <i>serious</i> branding for institutions and other
        <i>serious</i> things

        <h2>My other thoughts & opinions about this font</h2><br />
        <h5>
          <li>I like Baskerville more than the older fonts like Garamond</li>
          
          <li>The lesser contrast in the strokes as compared to older fonts feels more established on the paper whilst Garamond - the thin strokes of the fonts almost disappear</li>

          <li>the smaller circumference at the terminal (the round part of the beginning f) give it less of the inked by pen vibes.</li>
