      The typeface was designed by John Baskerville in 1757, Birmingham England.
      Typography cut by punchcutter John Handy. <br /><br />
      It is also called a "Transitional typeface" with a higher contrast between thick and thin
      strokes with a vertical axis.
      <br /><br />
      Isaac Moore created a later version of this font called “Fry’s baskervile” or “Baskerville
      old Face”
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h2>History & technical context of its design</h2><br />
      <h5>
        Baskerville made his money by selling lacquered goods and transformed
        the quality of printing in england by using level presses, better
        quality ink and glazing papers to have a smooth finish (it
        was called woven paper)
        <br /><br />
        He was also a calligraphy teacher that heavily inspired his font. His
        typeface is very similar to the tombstones he used to carve in the
        1730s. He spent seven years developing his printing project and
        advertised in 1754 in books like Vergil and Paradise lost. In 1758, he
        became the University Printer in Cambridge University Press.
        <br /><br />
        He wasn’t successful in the local england print scene, initially. People
        went as far as to say his font damaged their eyes after reading them. But abroad he had
        started garnering fans (imitators even) like Benjamin Franklin (yes,
        that benjamin franklin, he started out as a printer), Giambattista
        Bodoni who wrote him letters praising his work.
        <br /><br />
        Also to be noted, Bold weights were not present in his original
        rendition that were only added in modern revivals

      <h2>Uses</h2><br />
      <h5>
        In the past Baskerville was used to print <i>serious</i> books such as previously
        mentioned vergil, a paradise lost, versions of the bible. <br />
        Currently it is used for <i>serious</i> branding for institutions and other
        <i>serious</i> things

        <h2>My other thoughts & opinions about this font</h2><br />
        <h5>
          <li>I like Baskerville more than the older fonts like Garamond</li>
          
          <li>The higher contrast in the strokes as compared to older fonts feels more established on the paper as compared to Garamond</li>

          <li>the smaller circumference at the terminal (the round part of the beginning f) give it less of the inked by pen vibes.</li>
